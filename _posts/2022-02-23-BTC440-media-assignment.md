This research project centers a primary topic of AI-driven Network Security. There are 3 main factors that we plan on covering in this project. The first factor addressing the current issues in network security, the second factor is the discussing the advantages of Machine Learning and AI, and the third factor is going over the benefits of AI in network security specifically. 


The current issues in network security primarily lie with the sheer amount of products that are being distributed, ultimately resulting in a lack of combability and “Band-Aid solutions”. This results in too much manual work being put into essentially what is an automated process, further snowballing into slow response times and burning company money.


The second major point of the topic is the advantages of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Using an approach that is designed to constantly learn and adapt to new information is critical in the world of network security, where new attacks are being sent every day. Rather than a traditional style of defense where all of the behaviours and signatures are pre-set, a machine learning model allows for adaptability and change in a field that definitely needs it. 


Applying these 2 concepts together brings this research project to its final main point. The benefits of ML and AI in network security. There are several advantages if this is implemented correctly, saving companies potentially tens thousands of dollars of manpower. AI will process the massive amounts of data. It will be able to adapt and improve the experience of the users on the network by reducing latency and downtime. Using an AI-driven system can prevent new and innovative attacks before they occur by determining what is non-malicious beforehand quicker than any human could do manually. These are just some of the major advantages to a network security solution driven by AI.
